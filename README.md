## Setup

### Prerequisites

You'll need a LumbreTravel Client ID and Client Secret to use this server.  You can get one for free at https://developers.mercadolibre.com/, create an application and get the credentials.

Once you have the credentials, you can set the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables.

### Installation

There are two ways to use this server:

#### Option 1: NPX (Recommended)
Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lumbretravel-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "lumbretravel-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
        "USERNAME": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
        "PASSWORD": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
#### Option 2: Local Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Add this configuration to your Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lumbretravel-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/lumbretravel-mcp/dist/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "CLIENT_ID": "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
        "CLIENT_SECRET": "<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>",
        "USERNAME": "<YOUR_USERNAME>",
        "PASSWORD": "<YOUR_PASSWORD>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.
